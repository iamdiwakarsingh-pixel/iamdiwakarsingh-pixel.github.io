You are an expert full-stack developer and UI/UX designer.
Create a personal academic website for Dr. Diwakar Singh with a Spiritual + Academic visual theme.
Use smooth animations, serif fonts mixed with clean sans-serif, soft earthy colors (saffron, deep blue, white, gold accents), and subtle Indian philosophical motifs (Mandala lines, light gradients, minimal geometric symbolism).
The website must contain clean, modular code using React + Tailwind CSS (preferred).
If React is not possible, then build it in HTML/CSS/JS but maintain component-like structure.
